# Introduction

UCPD releases three types of data on their data page. This data is not directly downloadable and was web scraped into a database which was then standardized. The three types of data include *[The Daily Incident Report](https://incidentreports.uchicago.edu/)*, which includes crimes and fires reported to UCPD in its patrol area, *[Traffic Stops](https://incidentreports.uchicago.edu/trafficStops.php)*, and *[Field Interviews](https://incidentreports.uchicago.edu/fieldInterviews.php)*.

# Summary

*Data includes `r str_glue("{min(incident$Occured, na.rm=T)} to {max(incident$Occured, na.rm=T)}")`.*

The University of Chicago Police Department (UCPD) polices about 3.5 square miles of Chicago's south side. About 50,000 Chicagoans, of which about 50% are African American, live permanently in their patrol area. UCPD's data shows that African Americans are stopped, searched, and cited at rates higher than any other racial group. Including that:

- Since 2015, <b>`r fact_1` of street interviews</b> UCPD conducted were with African Americans
- During traffic stops, African Americans received citations at almost double the rate of non-African Americans <b>(`r fact_2`)</b>
- UCPD searches `r fact_3`
- Half of all searches conducted on African Americans ended without a citation
- 36 out of 37 traffic stop searches in 2019 were conducted on African American drivers
- In 2019, African Americans were cited at 10.8% and non-African Americans were cited at 6.0%

## Last 365 Days

```{r}
maxd <- max(incident$Occured)
mind <- maxd - 365

lasty_traffic <- traffic %>% filter(Date >= max(Date) - 365*24*60*60)
lasty_interview <- interview%>% filter(Date >= max(Date) - 365*24*60*60)

lasty_searched <- lasty_traffic %>% count(searched, is_black)
lasty_cited <- lasty_traffic %>% count(cited, is_black)

s1 <- lasty_searched %>% summarize(n = sum(n[searched == 1])) %>% pull(n)
s2 <- lasty_searched %>% summarize(n = sum(n[searched == 1 & is_black == 1])) %>% pull(n)

i1 <- lasty_cited %>% summarize(n = sum(n[cited == 1])) %>% pull(n)
i2 <- lasty_cited %>% summarize(n = sum(n[cited == 1 & is_black == 1])) %>% pull(n)
```


For the last 12 months of data which range from `r str_glue("{mind} to {maxd}")`.

- For the last 12 months, `r str_glue("there have been {nrow(lasty_traffic)} traffic stops. {sum(lasty_traffic$is_black)} drivers were African American ({percent(sum(lasty_traffic$is_black) / nrow(lasty_traffic))}).")`
- For the last 12 months, `r str_glue("there have been {nrow(lasty_interview)} interviews. {sum(lasty_interview$is_black)} of the interviewed were African American ({percent(sum(lasty_interview$is_black) / nrow(lasty_interview))}).")`
- For the last 12 months, UCPD has searched `r str_glue("{s1} drivers. {s2} were African American ({percent(s2/s1)}).")`
- For the last 12 months, UCPD has issued `r str_glue("{i1} citations. {i2} were issued to African American drivers ({percent(i2/i1)}).")`
